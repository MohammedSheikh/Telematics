The purpose of this project is to understand how the Controller Area Network (CAN) operates and allows for wired communication between CAN nodes. CAN is a widely used communications protocol which has a lot of uses in the modern world; it is typically found in industrial applications, the automotive industry etc. For example, vehicles have integrated CAN networks that allow Electrical Control Units (ECUâ€™s) to communicate with each other.
